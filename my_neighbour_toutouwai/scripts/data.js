    "description": "One of the first of the 2023 fledglings banded, and a regular sight on Highbury Fling. Found by someone and taken to the vet clinic at the zoo. This was the report received by Zealandia: 'Just wanted to let you know we had a NI Robin in which was found on Highbury Fling unable to fly. He presented with a chest wound and difficulty breathing on Saturday (18/2/23) and has been stabilised for 48 hours then had a GA for full evaluation today (20/02/23). Unfortunately the outcome was a sad one - the chest wound was large and old with dead skin and pectoral muscle covering much of the chest, plus the wound extended down towards one leg where the tissue was also very badly damaged. The chances of return to full function were minimal so he was humanely euthanased.'",
